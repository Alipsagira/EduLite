# EduLite 🧠

EduLite is a lightweight learning portal built for students in regions with limited internet access and device power.

## 🌍 Purpose
Designed for the Africa Deep Tech Challenge 2025, EduLite demonstrates how resource-constrained environments can still support interactive learning through efficient front-end design.

## ⚙️ Features
- Offline-ready lesson viewer
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Clear fallbacks for unavailable content
- No frameworks or external dependencies

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Local file access and simulated offline logic

## 🧩 How It Works
Lessons are either locally stored (like lesson1) or simulated as unavailable via alert prompts. The app shows how educational content can be delivered with minimal data and hardware load.
